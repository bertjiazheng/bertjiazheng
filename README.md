- [CAD2Program [AAAI 2025]](https://manycore-research.github.io/CAD2Program/): a vision-language model to 3D parametric model reconstruction from 2D CAD drawings.
- [PlankAssembly [ICCV 2023]](https://manycore-research.github.io/PlankAssembly/): the first deep generative models in the task of 3D CAD model reconstruction from three orthographic views.
- [Faceformer [CVPR 2022]](https://manycore-research.github.io/faceformer/): the first data-driven approach to identify face loops from a single line drawing.
- [NonCuboidRoom [WACV 2022]](https://github.com/CYang0515/NonCuboidRoom): a single-view 3D non-cuboid room layout reconstruction approach.
- [Structured3D [ECCV 2020]](http://structured3d-dataset.org): a large-scale photo-realistic dataset for data-driven structured 3D reconstruction.
- [PlaneAE [CVPR 2019]](https://github.com/svip-lab/PlanarReconstruction): a single-view piece-wise 3D planar reconstruction approach.
